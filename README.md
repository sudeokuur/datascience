Hello everyone! I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering student and I want to improve myself in Data Science & Machine Learning topics.

I have a Kaggle account (https://www.kaggle.com/sudeokuur) which I'm currently writing notebooks and sharing to people whose can take advantage. 
I also wanted to share my open-source codes via Github with this repo. 

If you have any problems & recommendations, please let me know it ☺️
